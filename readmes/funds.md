# Funds

We make use of funds in order to formally separate token holdings meant for different purposes, even when these tokens have a common owner. We perform this separation both for ease of accounting and also to exhibit an optical separation of token holdings for ease of understanding by the broader community. We make use of two different types of funds. The first is a governance fund, which is owned by the governance contract. Therefore, any use of the tokens in a governance fund must be approved via DAO vote. The second is a multisig fund, which is owned by the team multisig. The governance funds and the multisig funds are the same, except for their manner of access control. They are both implementations of Transactor.sol, whose purpose is to allow the owner (and only the owner) to perform arbitrary actions with the tokens held by the fund.

# TimeLock

TimeLock allows holders of KAP to participate in the DAO process while keeping their tokens semi-liquid. Holders can lock their tokens for `lockPeriod` (which is currently set to 2 weeks) and delegate their voting to a user of their choosing, themselves included. Their delegated voting weight persists after their lock period ends, but is reset once they withdraw or lock additional tokens.

# Interfaces

We take a practical, rather than comprehensive, approach to interfaces. By this we mean that a function is only included in the interface if it must be called by another contract in the Kapital DAO protocol. We hope that this better emphasizes the relationships (or lack thereof) between the various contracts. We also typically include events and structs in the interfaces to improve the readability of the core code of the contracts.
